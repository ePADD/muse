on
barter
deals
officials
keen
to
cut
capital
flight
will
adopt
tight
measures
to
cut
barter
deals
in
foreign
trade
to
a
minimum
a
customs
official
said
on
friday
we
have
always
been
concerned
about
barter
deals
with
other
countries
viewing
them
as
a
disguised
kind
of
capital
flight
from
deputy
head
of
the
currency
department
at
the
told
said
last
year
goods
had
been
exported
under
many
barter
deals
with
nothing
imported
in
return
she
said
the
cost
of
such
unimported
goods
was
billion
in
barter
deals
were
worth
billion
last
year
or
about
eight
percent
of
all
exports
estimated
at
billion
she
said
the
cost
of
exported
goods
is
too
often
understated
so
the
actual
share
of
barter
deals
in
exports
and
the
amount
of
unimported
goods
may
be
even
higher
said
a
few
days
ago
president
issued
a
decree
on
state
regulation
of
foreign
barter
deals
and
said
this
could
substantially
improve
the
situation
in
line
with
the
decree
which
will
come
into
force
on
november
all
barter
traders
will
be
obliged
to
import
goods
worth
the
cost
of
their
exports
within
days
if
traders
are
late
they
will
have
to
pay
fines
worth
the
cost
of
their
exported
goods
said
understating
the
cost
of
exported
goods
could
still
be
a
loophole
for
barter
dealers
but
said
the
authorities
are
currently
tackling
the
technicalities
of
the
issue
barter
has
always
been
a
feature
of
the
foreign
trade
but
decrees
liberalising
foreign
trade
in
has
given
barter
a
new
impetus
a
few
years
ago
barter
deals
accounted
for
up
to
percent
of
exports
because
thousands
of
trade
companies
which
popped
up
preferred
barter
in
the
absence
of
reliable
banks
and
money
transfer
systems
said
now
many
banks
are
strong
and
can
make
various
sorts
of
money
tranfers
while
incompetent
traders
are
being
ousted
by
more
experienced
ones
but
the
current
share
of
barter
deals
in
exports
is
still
high

he

also

my

pretty

because
my

was
only
in

put
those
two
things
together
and
you
get
a
loss
missed
weeks
after
wrist
surgery
earlier
this

and
the

away
from

has
given
him
a
new
perspective
before
when
i
was

i
always

by

and
i
had

up

said
now
i
can

at

wake

in

i
just
do
have
as
many

routines
and
it

me
a
happier
person
was
pleased
with
his
victory
over
his
first
in

meetings
with
the
it
always
difficult
to
win
a
match
when
you
lose
the
first
set
especially
against
someone
you
have
never
beaten
he
said
i
got
more
aggressive
in
the
second
and
third
sets
and
the
wind
picked
up
and
that
also
affected
things

definitely
went

he

bid
after
the
round
of

cuts
due
to
the
fact
these

stay
low
at

the

the

cut

took

by
surprise
volatility
has
a

to
it
volatility
more
than
because
the
event
people
were
buying
for
has
passed
and
now
perhaps
people
will
sell
some
short
dated
vol
and
buy
some
long
dated
vol
he
said
long
dated
volatility
has
been
low
this
year
so
it
is
still
at
levels
which
are
not
historically
high
it
is
not
a
dangerous
level
to
own
you
are
not
going
to
lose
a
lot
and
you
could
make
quite
a
bit
he
said
volatility
levels
should
be
stable
until
markets
reassess
the
situation
after
a
long
weekend
in
options
specialist
said
that
if
volatility
continued
lower
for
the
rest
of
friday
in
it
should
be
higher
next
tuesday
he
said
the
absence
on
holiday
of
many
market
makers
was
a
main
factor
behind
falls
this
week
in
volatility
in
markets
such
as
and
said
the
market
had
more
downside
than
upside
potential
but
a
fall
was
not
likely
to
be
of
significant
size
i
recommend
people
sell
strangles
in
a
number
of
markets
in
and
in
particular
with
markets
will
be
a
lot
more
vulnerable
in
september
on
economic
and
political
fronts
so
i
would
use
current
the
low
level
of
vol
to
buy
options
so
sell

computer

even
though
more

been
sold

it
the

ever
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
any
product
to
live
up
to
the
unprecedented
hype
of
the
launch
when
stores
around
the
world
opened
at
midnight
to
greet
long
lines
of
customers
the
company
spent
tens
of
millions
of

that
included
buying
the
entire

late

well
as

with
scores
of

companies
that
had
hoped
for
a
big
boost
in

were
disappointed
when
only
a
brief
spike
materialized
people
who
were
expecting
major
were
somewhat
disappointed
said
an
analyst
with
it
not
as
though
it
has
had
an
impact
he
said
it
just
has
had
the
huge
impact
some
people
were
looking
for
which
had
been
among
the
most
bullish
of
software
companies
at
the
time
of
the
launch

up
posting
disappointing
financial
results
when

fell
short

its
projections

cash
and

to
settle
a
shareholders
lawsuit
brought
after
the

sales
failed
to

expectations
tied
to
the
launch
many
software
developers
apparently
saw
their
crucial
holiday
season
sales
suffer
last
year
because
store
shelves
were
jammed
with
boxes
of
resulting
in
a
shortage
of

for

said

of
to
be
sure
sales
of

the
accompanying

drove

up

the
industry
dominant
company
executives
say
they
are
thrilled
with
the
sales
figures
and
industry
analysts
estimate
that
by
sometime
next
year
the
installed
base
of
will
surpass
that
of
the
older
version
of
now
used
on
about
million
computers
worldwide
but
said
the
figure
could
have
been
even
higher
if
had
done
a
better
job
of
handling
the
huge
demand
for
technical
support
from
customers
who
were
frustrated
trying
to
install
the
system
he
and
other
analysts
said
corporate
adopted
a
approach
because
already
was
promoting
the
new
version
of
its
operating
system
expected
to
be
available
in
stores
in
the
next
several
weeks
sent
a
lot
of
signals
that
was
going
to
be
the
answer
said
many
people
began
to
believe
that
was
being
downplayed
but
now
that
has
been
launched
and
others
believe
only
a
relatively
small
proportion
of
corporate
users
will
elect
to
pay
the
added
software
and
hardware
costs
needed
to
use
it
instead
of

going

he
said
the
mistake
people
made
was
in

it

going

sweeping

than
a
slow

copper

trade
up
to
tonnes
of

held
in
bonded

confounding
the
world
market
as
to
its
source
and
ultimate
fate
probably
belongs
to
strategic
state
reserve
industry
sources
said
on
friday
around
tonnes
of
the
copper
have
already
been
moved
to
warehouses
near
the
northern
port
of
where
some
of
the
strategic
stockpile
was
stored
they
said
just
who
owns
the
copper
is
a
question
that
has
kept
traders
and
industry
analysts
guessing
since
the
metal
was
channelled
into
by
the
in
june
and
july
it
was
unclear
whether
or
not
the
tonnes
had
cleared
customs
which
would
provide
some
concrete
indication
that
the
strategic
reserve
administered
directly
by
the
central
government
owned
the
copper
traders
have
said
the
reserve
could
negotiate
concessions
on
duties
three
percent
import
tax
and
percent
tax
that
made
the
copper
prohibitively
expensive
otherwise
but
one
source
the
head
of
a
trading
house
said
it
made
no
difference
if
the
copper
was
customs
cleared
or
not
if
they
spend
all
this
money
moving
the
copper
to
it
will
be
sitting
there
for
years
he
said
once
it
arrives
in
it
is
subject
to
monitoring
by
the
which
has
to
give
permission
for
any
more
movement
it
is
out
of
the
hands
of
traders
he
said
mystery
has
surrounded
the
stockpile
in
recent
months
with
traders
unsure
not
only
of
who
owns
it
but
of
its
exact
size
and
what
its
owner
planned
to
do
with
it
trading
sources
generally
agreed
it
would
be
to
take
the
copper
back
into
a
depleted
central
reserve
as
it
had
already
served
its
purpose
in
taking
advantage
of
backwardation
on
the
a
backwardation
occurs
when
the
spot
price
of
a
metal
is
higher
than
the
forward
price
lent
around
tonnes
of
copper
onto
the
between
april
and
june
on
behalf
of
the
state
reserve
running
the
state
stockpile
down
to
tonnes
from
tonnes
previously
traders
in
said
could
well
have
lent
it
to
the
market
at
around
a
tonne
and
then
paid
somewhere
between
and
a
tonne
when
it
started
taking
the
metal
back
earlier
this
year
this
would
have
cleared
a
healthy
profit
which
could
then
have
been
used
to
finance
storage
and
other
costs
word
that
had
offered
the
copper
to
trading
houses
in
a
series
of
secret
meetings

an
already
jittery
market
industry
analysts
said
on
wednesday
the
motivation
of
the
owners
of
the
tonnes
whoever
they
are
is
the
most
important
fundamental
in
an
already
tight
world
market
repeated
in
its
latest
review
rumours
of
involvement
by
with
said
to
be
helping
the
trader
unload
its
copper
positions
after
it
revealed
in
june
losses
of
billion
in
a
decade
of
unauthorised
deals
and
have
made
no
comments
on
the
talk
and
traders
said
they
know
nothing
of
such
an
arrangement
traders
in
said
on
thursday
they
were
unaware
of
movements
out
of
the
bonded
warehouses
they
reported
more
arrivals
that
were
probably
spot
purchases
they
also
expressed
concern
that
the
tonnage
in
bonded
warehouses
would
move
onto
the
domestic
market
but
these
concerns
were
irrelevant
a
trader
said
despite
a
forecast
that
domestic
copper
demand
could
hit
one
million
tonnes
this
year
as
with
many
commodities
there
is
a
desire
by
the
government
to
keep
a

around

the

the

for
the
kick
the
maul
was
there
and
i
was
going

but
i
thought
i
should
hold
off
because
we
had
the
ball
when
halfback

the

he
was
going

go
on
the
openside
where

i

at
him

this

i
just
hit
through
and
i
was

there

they

kept
coming
at
you
he
said
i
was
gone
in

completely
exhausted
but
you
had
no
choice
there
was
just
so
much
riding
on

it

yet

from
apartheid
enforcers
truth
commission
begins
issuing
subpoenas
this
week
in

beneath
the
political
rationales

find
the
sinister
figures
who
have
the
blood
of
the

race
war
on

leaders
of
the
major
parties
involved
from
whites
to
radical
blacks
appeared
before
archbishop
last
week
to
paint
the
broad
picture
of
their
actions
for
or
against
apartheid
most
including
former
president
and
deputy
president
offered
apologies
for
any
mistakes
they
had
made
and
accepted
broad
responsibility
for
the
actions
of
their
foot
soldiers
but
none
named
those
guilty
of
ordering
or
carrying
out
any
of
the
gross
violations
of
human
rights
which
is
investigating
human
rights
lawyer
said
the
hearings
last
week
were
not
intended
as
a
form
of
confessional
and
that
those
who
personally
committed
crimes
during
apartheid
would
testify
only
before
a
separate
arm
of
the
commission
the
amnesty
committee
i
do
think
one
should
have
expected
more
than
what
one
got
he
said
that
was
not
the
amnesty
committee
where
perpetrators
are
expected
to
open
their
hearts
and
souls
and
to
tell
it
all
the
commission
which
has
the
power
to
grant
amnesty
to
those
who
confess
to
abuses
has
begun
hearing
the
testimony
from
people
already
in
jail
for
their
deeds
but
others
such
as
secret
police
leader
have
yet
to
testify
deputy
chairman
told
reporters
the
commission
would
begin
issuing
subpoenas
to
suspects
who
refused
to
appear
voluntarily
some
time
this
week
he
added
that
former
hardline
apartheid
president
could
be
among
those
called
but
who
is
advising
several
people
regarded
as
perpetrators
said
this
was
not
the
best
way
to
achieve
the
commission
aims
a
person
can
be
forced
to
appear
but
the
only
way
one
is
going
to
get
to
the
truth
in
its
totality
is
if
people
feel
it
is
a
good
idea
to
go
to
the
amnesty
committee
at
the
moment
this
is
not
the
case
he
cited
who
was
charged
with
murder
after
confessing
in
media
interviews
to
dirty
tricks
his
trial
is
due
to
start
in
december
but
the
truth
commission
intends
to
decide
on
his
amnesty
application
before
that
said
the
law
had
to
be
changed
so
all
judicial
prosecutions
were
automatically
suspended
for
those
who
approached
the
truth
commission
last
week
submissions
to
the
commission
by
the
and
the
of
general
left
many
unsatisfied
said
the
picture
was
incomplete
because
officers
of
the
security
forces
had
yet
to
make
their
scheduled
separate
submission
but
one
black
caller
to
a
radio
talk
show
declared
this
whole
thing
is
utterly
useless
it
does
help
us
at
all
what
the
people
expect
is
to
have
houses
to
have
jobs
political
scientist
said
he
doubted
that
the
which
implemented
apartheid
in
and
began
dismantling
it
in
felt
it
carried
a
burden
of
guilt
and
needed
to
be
exculpated
through
the
commission
therefore
i
have
some
doubts
about
achieving
some
form
of
reconciliation
one
has
to
feel
a
bit
guilty
to
feel
the
need
for
reconciling
yourself
to
a
historical
adversary
he
said
professor
of
the
demurred
saying
in
the
irritation
in
the
jokes
in
the
anger
that
white
express
about
the
commission
i
think
there
a
moral
uneasiness
and
i
think
that
healthy
responsibility
is
percolating
downwards
refugees
seek

of

denounced

a
farce
on

incomers
would
be
able
to

old

cementing

they

they

critics
say
that
what
was
billed
as
an
electoral
process
to
reintegrate
as
a
single
state
is
shaping
up
as
a
referendum
on

de

only
our
physical
presence
in
will
mean
that
the
peace
treaty
has
truly
been
implemented
told
the

the

point
of
this

is
to
highlight

what
misfortune
they
brought
upon
us

will
stop
us
from
returning

our
homes
a
government
refugee
official
said
we
want
to
vote
where
we
were
thrown
out
from
this
is
a
protest
of
warning
and
the
next
step
is
entering
our
town

all
means
possible
so
let
them

told
the

we
have
a
message
for
the
who
are
now
in

the
future
of
their
children
there

there

taking

corporate
is
planning
major
changes
in
employee
compensation
in
the
next
few
years
according
to
a
recent
study
what
it
comes
down
to
is
this
if
you
highly
skilled
you
benefit
nicely
but
if
you
not
and
cannot
contribute
to
your
employer
goals
you
be
paid
less
the
survey
conducted
in
late
and
the
early
part
of
this
year
by
management
consulting
firm
showed
that
the
focus
will
be
on
an
employee
overall
value
to
the
company
bottom
line
rather
than
how
well
an
employee
performs
a
specific
task
presently
for
example
if
an
accountant
job
involves
doing
five
specific
tasks
he
or
she
can
expect
a
certain
salary
said
a
principal
in
the
future
the
accountant
will
be
evaluated
solely
on
knowledge
skill
and
abilities
she
said
in
addition
to
using
accounting
skills
the
accountant
will
also
have
to
be
creative
work
well
in
a
team
be
sensitive
to
customer
needs
and
set
productivity
goals
the
good
news
is
if
you
highly
skilled
and
have
many
abilities
you
be
paid
more
said
the
bad
news
is
if
you
not
skilled
and
ca
contribute

you
be

corporations
surveyed
percent
had
undergone
a
major
restructuring
in
the
last
three
years
and
more
than
reported
that
productivity
and
profits
were
up
as
result
next
on
the
agenda
for
these
firms
is
developing
a
new
compensation
structure
and
percent
report
that
they
are
considering
a
new
plan
for
both
management
and
employees
this
coming
shift
said
is
not
just
isolated
or
a
fad
it
an
inexorable
change
after
corporations
adopted
a
military
model
creating
hierarchical
organisations
where
the
concept
of
defined
tasks
worked
great
she
said
but
as
the
economy
became
global
customers
were
more
demanding
and
problems
became
more
complex
kept
management
at
a
distance
from
its
customers
said
now
organisations
must
change
to
stay
competitive
says
firms
will
place
a
greater
emphasis
on
teams
and
team
performance
in
giving
raises
if
your
team
does
well
you
do
well
if
it
does
do
well
do
expect
a
raise
is
this
fair
to
an
employee
who
can
go
the
distance
but
is
on
a
team
that
ca
keep
up
that
an
important
question
we
used
to
ask
a
lot
said
it
not
a
question
we
ask
any
more
the
more
important
question
is
do
we
have
results
to
get
those
results
percent
of
the
companies
surveyed
plan
to
eliminate
base
pay
increases
in
favour
of
cash
bonuses
and
incentives
such
as
employee
and
team
award
programmes
and
education
companies
that
can
change
their
culture
and
view
employees
as
business
partners
will
do
well
said
for
example
the
survey
rated
some
participants
in
the
survey
as
companies
based
on
their
return
on
equity
above
percent
those
companies
also
said
they
already
offer
employees
variable
pay
and
business
education
give
their
managers
more
control
over
pay
decisions
and
celebrate
employee
and
team
success
they
respect
employees
more
they
trust
employees
more
and
they
value
their
employees
more
said
the
key
to
success
at
companies

said
help
us
if
there
is
a
breakdown
he
said
of
the
machinery
loaned
to
the
farm
after
the
government
bought
it
earlier
this
year
the
country
grain
harvest
this
year
is
forecast
to
fall
by
more
than
percent
to
only
million
tonnes
and
two
harsh
factors
are
to
blame
a
drought
scoured
the
steppes
in
may
and
june
stunting
the
growing
wheat
and
the
farming
sector
making
the
painful
transition
from
central
planning
to
a
market
economy
simply
has
no
money
black
soil
is
so
fertile
that
a
diplomat
described
it
as
rich
enough
to
grow
rubber
boots
but
recently
has
been
losing
its
reputation
as
a
breadbasket
of
earned
in
the
years
before
brutal
forced
collectivisation
under
dictator
the
wheat
will
not
be
of
a
good
quality
this
year
said
a
scientist
at
the
run
by
the
the
temperature
on
the
ground
reached
decrees
fahrenheit
this
summer
we
never
seen
anything
so
bad
he
said
in
an
interview
in
his
office
unlit
since
the
government
cut
off
electricity
because
of
unpaid
power
bills
the
harvest
is
gathered
in
the
dry
areas
but
rainfall
in
has
delayed
harvesting
there
while
scientists
some
unpaid
for
months
carry
on
developing
new
strains
of
wheat
resistant
to
extreme
continental
climate
said
the
lack
of
cash
in
agricultural
sector
is
as
bad
as
the
drought
collective
farms
and
nascent
private
farming
sector
have
no
money
for
fertiliser
no
money
for
herbicides
and
pesticides
no
money
to
repair
old
or
buy
new
machinery
no
money
for
fuel
and
none
to
buy
good
seed
this
year
harvest
is
down
from
last
year
million
tonne
harvest
which
in
turn
compares
with
million
tonnes
in
the
year
before
independence
the
decline
is
all
the
worse
for
people
who
recall
wasteful
times
when
the
imported
grain
but
priced
bread
so
cheaply
that
people
bought
it
to
feed
their
pigs
agriculture
is
very
expensive
and
there
are
no
solutions
to
our
problems
on
the
horizon
said
he
said
his
farm
its
workers
now
readying
the
fields
for
winter
wheat
sowing
expected
the
land
to
yield
tonnes
per
hectare
acres
but
ended
up
with
tonnes
still
better
than
the
national
average
of
tonnes
per
hectare
this
year
we
did
not
have
money
for
fertiliser
we
in
debt
for
fuel
and
we
borrowing
diesel
said
a
few
kilometres
miles
down
the
road
which
passes
farm
where
the
occasional
buggy
passes
by
is
the
collective
farm
built
next
to
a
village
still
neat
and
tidy
despite
decay
chief
accountant
said
the
collective
is
strapped
for
cash
earlier
this
year
bartering
tonnes
of
grain
for
diesel
to
fuel
six
rickety
grain
combines
and
tractors
badly
in
need
of
repairs
and
basic
maintenance
the
average
family
earns
million
karbovanets
a
year
but
many
have
not
been
paid
in
months
said
people
are
working
out
of
their
own
dedication
said
the
farm
sector
has
two
options
we
can
sit
down
and
cry
or
we
can
do
something
he
said
the
government
plans
to
increase
the
sowing
of
the
winter
wheat
which
will
be
harvested
next
year
planted
in
late
summer
and
early
autumn
the
grain
is
largest
export
item
and
traditionally
grows
better
than
summer
wheat
in
soil
further
plans
he
said
called
for
full
provision
of
resources
like
fertiliser
and
herbicides
for
percent
of
arable
land
next
year
for
percent
in
and
percent
of
the
land
in
if
we
follow
this
we
be
able
to
sell
million
tonnes
of
grain
by
the
year
said
the
government
has
been
trying
to
phase
out
huge
subsidies
to
the
farm
sector
and
in
a
move
back
to
days
has
given
up
to
hectares
acres
of
land
to
some
private
farmers
willing
to
go
it
alone
collective
farms
will
last
for
the
next
few
years
because
most
private
farms
now
only
produce
enough
to
feed
themselves
with
maybe
a
little
extra
to
sell
said
one
private
farmer
in
the
future
maybe
but
it
better
not
to
hurry
collectivisation
brought
us
a
lot
of
pain
and
it
went
too
fast
privatising
too
quickly
can
also
have
a
negative
outcome
swells
profit
despite
setbacks
on
monday
said
it
had
swelled
its
year
attributable
profit
and
streamlined
operations
to
strengthen
it
for
the
current
financial
year
despite
a
variety
of
divisional
setbacks
announcing
the
group
results
for
the
year
ended
june
chairman
said
happily
the
strong
improvement
in
financial
performance
is
not
an
illusion
arising
from
the
recent
weakness
of
the
rand
relative
to
the
dollar
raised
attributable
earnings
to
million
rand
from
million
rand
previously
in
dollar
terms
an
increase
to
million
from
million
and
won
despite
the
group
posting
dismal
results
not
everything
has
gone
well
we
had
substantial
production
difficulties
at
a
number
of
our
operations
the
most
obvious
one
with
the
greatest
effect
on
the
corporation
was
at
where
we
had
the
furnace
failure
said
posted
year
attributable
profit
of
million
rand
from
million
previously
not
only
did
the
company
lock
in
rand
per
dollar
in
february
march
but
it
suffered
output
losses
due
to
a
furnace
shutdown
last
august
the
rand
was
last
bid
at
against
the
dollar
nor
was
the
only
operation
to
fail
output
targets
was
hit
hard
by
heavy
rains
it
forfeited
nearly
one
million
tonnes
of
production
to
flooding
at
its
mines
in
province
but
said
the
greatest
gloom
in
the
year
came
from
the
blocking
of
proposed
merger
with
platinum
interests
the
big
disappointment
for
the
year
was
the
failure
of
the
platinum
merger
from
perspective
we
are
taking
the
position
that
it
is
not
on
said
looking
ahead
to
the
current
financial
year
he
said
that
would
boost
earnings
further
is
well
placed
to
take
up
the
challenges
of
the
future
the
group
is
soundly
structured
and
prudently
financed
and
is
blessed
with
an
excellent
portfolio
of
businesses
i
think
we
can
look
forward
to
further
growth
citing
the

industrial
holdings
group
for
one
billion
rand
among
other
smaller
disposals
said
had
pruned
its
portfolio
to
concentrate
on
core
assets
we
tried
to
clean
up
our
overall
portfolio
by
disposing
of
assets
the
biggest
of
those
was
overall
a
very
substantial
pruning
leaving
clearly
structured
along
commodity
lines
said
he
added
that
the
group
still
had
about
million
rand
after
tax
invested
in
various
shares
which
were
market
for
disposal
when
required
referring
to
increased
percent
stake
in
said
the
group
would
wait
for
coal
shares
to
be
cheaper
before

snapping

think
we
would
have
liked
to
have

it
the
question
of
adding

when
we

the

we
bought
at
quite
a

were

on

in
a
hot
sunny
opening
to
the
tennis
championships
the
seeded
was
honoured
to
play
the
first
match
of
the
season
last
on
but
happy
to
hurry
off
with
a
victory
over
the
of
it
was
very
hot
and
i
did
want
to
stay
long
on
the
court
said
a
cheery
who
had
no
worries
in
racing
to
a
victory
against
the
overmatched
hoping
for
a
longer
engagement
on
the
cement
at
were
the
of
and
seed
of
who
lost
to
in
the
final
fell
victim
to
an
unfortunate
draw
in
bowing
to
dangerous
floater
of
ranked
avenged
her
defeat
to
in
the
semifinals
by
winning
i
looked
at
it
as
not
a
first
round
match
just
a
great
challenge
for
me
said
i
was
really
concentrating
on
keeping
my
own
momentum
and
my
own
rhythm
she
is
tough
to
play
in
that
way
because
she
plays
very
up
and
down
she
played
one
great
game
and
than
a
few
errors
the
challenge
was
just
for
me
to
keep
playing
my
own
game
who
reached
the
final
a
week
ago
at
could
only
mourn
her
luck
of
the
draw
i
was
happy
when
i
saw
the
draw
she
was
the
first
seeded
player
said
the
it
always
tough
to
play
somebody
like
that
in
the
first
round
in
a
i
think
i
did
play
that
bad
today
it
was
maybe
my
best
first
round
match
in
a
i
ever
played
monday
brought
the
best
out
in
rookie
of
ranked
the
last
year
junior
champion
celebrated
her
debut
in
the
main
draw
of
the
by
removing
the
victories
by
and
provided
a
ringing
endorsement
for
the
newest
wave
of
women
players
coming
up
from
the
junior
ranks
the
teenager
a
twice
junior
champion
and
a
juniors
winner
had
already
proven
her
main
stage
mettle
by
reaching
the
quarters
at
this
year
i
hope
i
can
get
into
the
last
said
seeded
to
face
third
seed
in
the
fourth
round
has
been
working
hard
on
conditioning
and
has
lost
eight
pounds
kilos
in
advance
of
the
championships
there
will
be
tough
matches
but
i
hope
i
can
get
there
she
said
then
we
see
if
will
be
there
too
the
was
cool
in
her
opening
match
i
was
scared
when
i
heard
that
i
was
playing
said
i
know
that
if
i
want
to
play
professional
tennis
i
have
to
do
my
best
to
try
to
beat
her
and
i
ca
be
scared
is
undaunted
by
the
level
of
competition
in
the
pros
in
terms
of
tennis
i
think
the
junior
players
are
really
good
now
in
a
few
years
it
could
change
a
lot
among
the
top
players
two
women
players
made
quick
work
of
opponents
of
the
the
seed
was
a
winner
over
while
veteran
prevailed
over
seeded
also
reached
the
second
round
with
a
victory
over
of
tennis
glad
he
stayed
after
victory
nearly
pulled
out
of
the
in
protest
over
the
men
seeding
fiasco
but
the
former
champion
was
glad
he
stayed
after
sweating
out
a
win
on
monday
over
qualifier
i
still
feel
it
embarrassing
what
happened
and
i
was
about
to
pull
out
yesterday
and
say
that
it
said
one
of
a
host
of
men
who
cried
foul
over
seeding
procedures
that
forced
an
unprecedented
remaking
of
the
men
draw
last
week
but
there
are
so
many
reasons
to
play
especially
spectators
and
the
kids
who
come
out
here
and
want
to
enjoy
watching
tennis
that
i
decided
to
stay
in
a
break
from
tradition
the
did
not
seed
in
strict
accordance
with
rankings
instead
taking
into
account
other
factors
that
raised
objections
of
favourtism
toward
players
one
prominent
player
that
did
not
stay
for
the
was
champion
who
after
being
dropped
three
spots
from
his
ranking
to
a
seventh
seeding
withdrew
and
returned
home
to
had
pulled
out
of
last
week
tournament
with
a
rib
injury
at
a
news
conference
attended
by
approximately
players
on
sunday
player
expressed
the
players
outrage
at
the
seedings
the
way
the
has
seeded
here
tampering
with
the
ranking
system
has
tarnished
the
image
and
reputation
of
this
in
the
players
mind
and
we
think
that
is
damaging
to
our
sport
said
said
he
felt
the
players
ought
to
have
organised
an
active
protest
i
feel
that
we
made
it
a
little
easy
for
the
they
did
really
get
hurt
as
much
as
i
think
they
should
have
said
i
feel
that
we
should
have
maybe
just
cancelled
out
the
monday
not
show
up
today
and
start
the
tournament
tomorrow
but
once
the
got
on
the
court
he
focused
his
energies
on
trying
to
win
the
year
last
he
took
a
positive
first
step
with
his
win
over
compatriot
on
a
court
others
advancing
early
on
monday
included
the
and
former
champion
of
who
will
be
next
opponent
the
suspicion
however
lingers
in
mind
that
officials
did
tamper
with
the
seeding
process
in
order
to
benefit
homegrown
players
i
get
the
feeling
that
everything
is
done
here
for
the
players
and
they
forget
about
all
the
other
players
said
who
lost
the
final
to
it
was
who
was
at
the
centre
of
the
controversy
that
engulfed
the
tournament
since
the
original
draw
was
completed
on
wednesday
the
flamboyant
star
was
bumped
up
two
spots
from
his
ranking
of
eight
to
a
seeding
of
six
he
should
be
seeded
the
way
he
is
playing
tennis
right
now
said
about
the
unfairness
of
moving
up
who
made
early
exits
from
the
and
not
seeded
here
for
the
first
time
since
might
have
benefitted
from
some
fiddling
with
the
seedings
himself
after
withdrew
ranked
in
the
world
might
have
been
slipped
into
that
spot
ahead
of
who
is
but
had
never
been
played
in
the
and
had
been
left
out
of
the
seedings
originally
but
did
want
to
play
that
game
i
think
he
deserves
to
be
seeded
as
everybody
else
who
is
in
the
top
deserves
to
be
seeded

may
finally
get
to
discuss
his
peace
proposals
with
on
tuesday
after
a
lost
weekend
in
the
region
when
he
was
forced
to
abandon
plans
to
sign
a
new
political
treaty
with
the
separatist
rebels
it
could
be
a
sobering
experience
for
the
security
chief
who
just
two
months
after
being
appointed
by
the
president
and
two
heady
weeks
after
taking
charge
of
the
crisis
had
promised
to
wrap
up
the
war
by
the
weekend
despite
a
mood
of
compromise
in
the
region
after
some
of
the
worst
fighting
of
the
war
may
be
just
finding
out
that
concluding
a
settlement
somewhere
between
rebel
demands
for
independence
and
insistence
that
remain
part
of
will
be
no
easy
matter
a
former
paratroop
general
with
a
sharp
line
in
deadpan
putdowns
and
a
soldier
knack
for
making
life
sound
simple
managed
to
arrange
an
ambitious
ceasefire
in
the
region
last
week
days
after
the
army
threatened
to
bomb
its
way
back
into
the
capital
he
returned
at
the
weekend
pledging
to
conclude
a
political
settlement
that
would
make
this
truce
work
where
all
others
have
failed
but
then
he
apparently
thought
better
of
it
saying
he
needed
to
tidy
up
legal
loose
ends
on
the
deal
and
also
cover
his
back
against
unnamed
schemers
in
he
flew
back
to
the
capital
on
sunday
he
met
prime
minister
on
monday
and
according
to
the

it

the

announced
later
would

on

the
rounds
of

departments
it

what
caused
the

in

speculation
mounted
last

that

on
a
limb
in
as
hardly
seen
since
his
reelection
last
month
kept
out
of
sight
and
then
gave
an
interview
criticising
his
envoy
just
as
he
clinched
a
truce
but
took
pains
at
the
weekend
to
insist
was
playing
for
a
united
team
and
that
the
proposals
he
took
to
rebel
had
been
agreed
by
if
that
were
the
case
it
was
unclear
why
suddenly
found
it
necessary
to
have
the
deal
verified
in
himself
said
he
was
concerned
that
powerful
interests
in
who
have
profited
from
the
war
and
want
it
to
go
on
would
seize
on
any
inadequacy
in
the
deal
to
remove
him

that
risked
the

fate

to
both
sides

at

said
voters
should

stressed
there
was
no

one

protestor
under

journal
earlier
this

if
it
comes
down
to
economic
warfare
we
will
aim
to
drive
them
out
of
business
as
well
as
financial
threats
companies
also
emphasise
the
terror
tactics
used
contract
to
build
the

a
spokesman
told
we
had
all
sorts
of
protests
at
the
head
office
and
the
chief
executive
house
but
it
when
it
gets
to
the
employee
families
that
it
goes
across
the
line
tactics
used
by
some
underground
groups
including
the
cryptic
which
distribute
leaflets
with
instructions
on
explosives
are
now
the
subject
of
a
police
investigation
other
larger
activist
groups
include
and
the
groups
have
targeted
specific
projects
like
the
bypass
and
the
motorway
through
in
the
southern
county
of
but
they
are
also
campaigning
on
broader
issue
such
as
stopping
the
government
road
building
programme
and
superstores
which
they
say
create
more
traffic
pollution
and
damage
local
communities
the
government
has
slashed
its
spending
although
protests
may
have
contributed
to
the
decision
it
has
been
seen
primarily
as
economic
rather
than
ecological
chief
executive
of
the
said
i
do
think
many
firms
involved
in
tendering
for
sensitive
projects
realise
the
impact
environmental
activity
has
on
the
cost
of
running
a
project
but
they
are
more
alert
than
they
were
years
ago
there
no
doubt
it
a
big
issue
now
he
says
the
damage
comes
in
two
forms
tangible
in
the
form
of
extra
costs
additional
security
threats
to
staff
and
the
more
intangible
damage
caused
by
negative
publicity
said
the
cost
of
protesting
can
be
heavy
once
the
company
is
locked
into
a
contract
i
do
often
hear
on
the
industry
circuit
of
tales
where
the
company
tenders
at
low
margins
and
the
demonstrations
which
follow
means
they
are
running
the
project
at
a
loss
says
it
not
just
contractors
in
the
front
line
but
also
suppliers
like
itself
its
own
quarries
came
under
attack
after
it
emerged
that
it
may
be
a
supplier
for
the
bypass
it
was
called
the
said
we
had
protestors
invade
and
occupy
our
site
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
dollars
of
damage
was
done
in
one
day
plus
there
was
the
cost
of
lost
production
and
extra
security
in
future
analyst
at
investement
bank
said
this
new
phenomenon
has
led
to
a
change
in
the
way
the
industry
evaluates
project
risk
when
talking
to
about
the
link
through
they
made
it
fairly
clear
that
their
risk
assessment
methods
have
been
changed
and
now
involve
a
very
clear
environmental
risk
analysis
says
others
have
done
the
same
as
a
result
of
we
are
looking
at
controversial
jobs
more
closely
to
see
if
the
profit
margins
are
wide
enough
to
cover
things
like
extra

for
an
industry

the

a

the

despite

however

the

just

at

it
an
advantage
for
that
it
has
a
foreign
management
which
perhaps
understands
the

better
added
is
a
very
good
story
in
the
as
the
per

packaging

is
still
so
low
in

that
a
very
strong

rules
to
improve
investor
access
to
best
stock
prices
the
wednesday
approved
rules
designed
to
give
stock
market
investors
a
better
chance
at
getting
the
best
price
available
for
their
orders
the
order
handling
rules
which
were
proposed
last
september
were
approved
in
a
vote
the
new
rules
will
require
specialists
at
stock
exchanges
and
market
makers
on
to
allow
customers
to
view
price
quotes
from
other
electronic
trading
systems
that
may
not
be
readily
available
to
them
the
rules
will
also
require
that
customer
limit
orders
be
displayed
with
prices
better
than
those
available
in
quotes
publicly
available
at
the
time
specialists
and
market
makers
are
companies
or
individuals
recognised
as
qualified
to
maintain
an
orderly
market
in
a
stock
in
a
limit
order
investors
specify
the
price
at
which
they
are
willing
to
buy
or
sell
as
opposed
to
a
market
order
executed
at
prevailing
prices
these
rules
are
intended
to
empower
all
investors
by
allowing
their
orders
to
compete
on
a
level
playing
field
and
by
providing
the
disclosure
they
need
to
make
informed
decisions
said
chairman
the
goal
he
added
was
to
create
one
system
where
one
price
could
be
available
to
everybody
the
director
of
the
division
of
market
regulation
said
firms
will
probably
need
to
spend
about
million
to
carry
out
the
improvements
called
for
by
the
new
rules
in
proposing
the
rules
last
year
the
noted
that
while
technology
has
improved
commonplace
practices
still
existed
that
worked
against
investors
best
interests
it
noted
that
customers
whose
orders
were
not
displayed
lost
the
chance
of
getting
the
best
possible
price
available
in
the
market
it
also
cited
the
potential
problem
of
a
market
in
which
market
makers
quote
one
price
to
public
investors
while
quoting
better
prices
in
private
systems
thus
robbing
investors
without
access
to
hidden
quotes
the
benefit
of
the
best
available
prices

this
month

charges
of
alleged
malpractices

the
agreed
to
spend

over
five
years
to
upgrade
its
oversight
of
brokers
trading
practices
the
dropped
a
third
proposal
that
would
have
allowed
investors
with
market
orders
to
trade
at
a
better
price
if
there
were
shifts
in
prices
before
their
orders
were
executed
the
agency
said
it
would
monitor
effects
of
the
two
new
rules
before
considering
the
price
improvement
proposal
again
the
agency
also
proposed
rule
changes
that
would
require
continuous
bid
and
ask
quotations
from
exchange
specialists
and
market
makers
who
trade
more
than
percent
of
a
stock
during
any
quarter
on

will

that
without
putting
percent
of
your

into

do
think
you
can
successful
said

the

all
the
other
things
i
was
doing
the
years
before
they
were
distracting
me
they
were
not
helping
me
at
all

about

two

his

it
a

that
i
have

winning
for

ordinary
the
fact
that
the
two
were
playing
each

was
rather
remarkable
in

still
under

that

unable

that
reached
is
a

ambassador
said
the

should
have
unconditional
negotiations
with
all
parties
inside

outside

he

strongly
supported
the
economic

imposed
already
and
if
these
did
not
work
the

would
consider
an

he

the

which
he
revelled
in

with
friendly
crowds
across
the

heartland
he
was
also
hoarse
and
was
giving
his
voice
a
rest
but
first
lady
told

he
really
fired
up
he
wants
to
outline
to
the
people
what
he
thinks

been
accomplished
in

four
years
and
what
he
would
like
to
see
done
in

next
four
years
she
said
he
very
excited
about
this
convention
he
excited
about

but
more
than
that
he
very
resolute
about
what
he
wants
to
do
i
do
take
anything
for

have
a

gene
responsible
for
producing
a
crucial
muscle
protein
called
dystrophin
in
the
study
at

researchers
altered
a

to
carry
a

dystrophin
gene
the

which
also
was
altered
to

said
on

he
was
financially
broken
by
his

against

charges
but
he
was
hopeful
new
evidence
to
support
him
would
be
available
for
a

next

the
former
football
star
was
found
not
guilty
by

trial
jury
last

of
the

of
his
former
wife
and
her
friend
in

he
now
faces
a
civil
suit
brought
by
families
of
the
victims
who
hold
him
responsible
for
the
deaths
he
told
reporters
a
court
order
not
to
talk
about
his
case
kept
him
from
detailing
how
he
has
fulfilled
his
pledge
to
find
the
killers
but
he
added
without
elaborating
hopefully
we
will
see
some
things
come
out
in
this
next
trial
the
judge
in
the
civil
trial
has
imposed
a
sweeping
gag
order
that
prohibits
lawyers
witnesses
and
parties
to
the
case
from
discussing
it
with
the
media
or
elsewhere
in
public
i
would
love
to
speak
about
everything
said
who
vowed
after
his
acquittal
to
find
the
killers
and
offered
a
substantial
reward
his
lawyers
have
said
his
defence
in
the
civil
trial
that
starts
sept
will
be
that
he
did
not
kill
the
victims
said
at
the
hotel
news
conference
his
plans
include
eventually
writing
another
book
he
added
that
he
has
had
job
offers
but
more
have
come
from
abroad
than
at
home
i
broke
i
am
not
crying
the
blues
i
can
get
along
just
fine
he
said
whatever
you
want
to
send
me
i
need
he
again
accused
the
news
media
of
erroneous
reporting
on
his
case
but
did
not
signal
any
plans
for
lawsuits
as
he
did
on

contrary

said
he

dismissed

that
he
had
distanced
himself

it

a

was
nevertheless
likely

the

the

said
on

the

remained
confident
about
the
general
prospects
for
its
operating
margins
despite
pressure
from
unsettled
markets
in
an
interview
following
its
results
which
included
a
less
optimistic
forecast
for
the
second
half
of
this

than
it
had
made
in
the
past
sir
said
had
taken
defensive
action
to
protect
it
from
patchy
markets
looking
at
market
prospects
he
said
i
think
our
best
judgment
at
this
stage
is
that
it
will
probably
bumble
along
in
the
rather
mixed
way
it
been
in
the
first
half
it
very
difficult
to
predict
the
market
trend
this
year
it
could
be
better
or
it
could
be
worse
added
echoing
the
demand
uncertainty
across
automotive
industries
you
can
see
anxieties
in
and
in
particular
beginning
to
grow
and
develop
however
is
looking
a
little
better
he
said
compared
with
the
end
of
last
year
when
predicted
a
sluggish
first
half
and
a
rebound
later
in
said
i
think
the
difference
now
is
the
first
half
has
not
actually
been
as
bad
as
some
felt
it
was
going
to
be
but
equally
we
certainly
not
predicting
a
recovery
in
the
second
half
against
this
background
said
the
group
was
glad
it
had
rationalised
and
destocked
even
though
this
had
pressed
margins
which
had
slipped
to
percent
from
percent
a
year
ago
i
think
the
figure
of
percent
on
the
first
half
when
you
consider
the
fact
that
we
been
destocking
the
fairly
mixed
customer
demand
and
the
fact
that
we
sold
the
southern
mines
actually
is
not
bad
it
does
show
how
easily
we
should
be
able
to
bounce
back
over
percent
again
he
added
saying
we
continue
to
feel
very
relaxed
about
our
general
view
that
we
would
average
percent
profit
margins
over
the
cycle
we
always
taken
the
view
that
we
are
the
sort
of
company
that
quite
capable
of
working
in
difficult
circumstances
we
rather
used
to
it
and
we
feel
very
confident
that
we
doing
all
the
right
things
said
when
the
profit
figures
will
bounce
back
up
again
is
just
a
function
of
markets
recovering
just
a
fraction
he
added
commenting
on
the
continued
struggle
to
get
control
of
piston
maker
which
has
been
hampered
by

obstacles
said
confidence
continues

it

solid
told
a

conference
after

there
will
be

it

be

said
he
said

the

solid
its

to
the

had
proved
an
engine
of

absolutely

said
he
described
the
condition
of
the
property
market
as
very
good
indeed
you
know
we
went
through
a
little
climb
and
a
little
trough
over
the
last
few
years
because
of
speculation
in
the
market
we
introduced
certain
measures
but
they
are
not
draconian
measures
and
we
brought
it
down
to
earth
said
the
market
would
continue
to
appreciate
because
property
and
land
were
scarce
the
government
would
put

on
the

to

said

at

anyone

awfully
big
shoes

spell

some

if

adding
that
could
hurt

to

still

little

successor
because
the
firm
dollar
policy
