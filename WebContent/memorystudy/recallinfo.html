        <u>What Does Tip-of-the-Tongue mean?</u>
    </div>
    <p>
    In this test, you will be asked to recall names of people you have emailed in the last one year. If you know the answer, type it in the space provided.
    </p>
    <p>
    When you feel you know the answer to a question but you can't remember it at the moment and you feel the answer is about to pop into mind at any second, then you are in a tip-of-the-tongue state.  For example I might remember that I sent an email to the president and I know his name but I cannot recall his name right now. It feels like his name is ready to POP into mind at any second. If this happens, choose the tip-of-the-tongue option.
    </p>
    <p>
    If you don't remember the name for other reasons, choose the option that best applies to you.
