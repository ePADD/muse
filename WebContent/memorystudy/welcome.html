       All of us have had the experience of forgetting the names of people we meet in our daily life. This memory test has been designed to test your memory for names of people you know, using email.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you participate in this study, you will be asked for your Gmail or Yahoo address and your sent emails from the last one year will be analyzed securely by a computer server here at Ashoka University, to generate questions for the memory test.
            At no point will your email be accessed or viewed by any person. Please <u><a href="privacy" style="color:black" target="_blank">click</a></u> here if you wish to understand the steps we take to ensure your privacy.
        </p>

        <p>
        The inability to recall specific names of objects or people is called anomia, which is an early symptom of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.
            Our research is an effort towards explaining the brain processes involved in anomia, and your participation would truly help us advance our research.
