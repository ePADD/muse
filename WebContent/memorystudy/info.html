            All of us have had the experience of forgetting the names of people we meet in our daily life. This memory test has been designed to test your memory for names of people you know, using email.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you participate in this study, you will be asked for your Gmail or Yahoo address and your sent emails from the last one year will be analyzed securely by a computer server here at Ashoka University, to generate questions for the memory test.
            At no point will your email be accessed or viewed by any person. Please <u><a href="privacy" style="color:black" target="_blank">click</a></u> here if you wish to understand the steps we take to ensure your privacy.
        </p>

       <p>
           <u>Why is this important?</u><br> Some forgetting is a normal, but in some brain diseases, a lot of information is lost. Our study develops a new approach which we hope will teach us more about memory and lead to new ways of studying and improving memory in patients. Your participation will help our research efforts. We hope you choose to participate and find this memory test interesting! Click on continue to begin the test.
