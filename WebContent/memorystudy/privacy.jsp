        At every step of this memory test, we will make sure that we protect your personal information using encryption.
        Whereas you will see information from your own email, the information we save from the study will include only the questions asked and the answers provided.
        This information is necessary for our research. Entire email messages will not be stored â€“ they will be permanently deleted as soon as the test is complete.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any data saved from the test will be saved on password-protected computers and media. All network connections with personal data (emails or data derived from email) will be over HTTPS.
        We take your privacy very seriously, and our staff has been trained to ensure and maintain data confidentiality.
